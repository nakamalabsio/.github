Welcome to the official GitHub organization for [NAKAMALABS.io](https://nakamalabs.io) — a global digital lab building reliable, scalable, and automated infrastructure solutions. We specialize in DevOps, Kubernetes, observability, and open data platforms.

## 🚀 What We Do

We design, build, and maintain systems with a strong emphasis on automation, security, and performance. Our focus is split across two core areas:

### ⚙️ DevOps & Infrastructure
- GitOps pipelines using **Terraform**, **GitHub Actions**, and **ArgoCD**
- Kubernetes deployments with **K3s**, **GKE**, and **self-hosted clusters**
- Monitoring and logging with **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Loki**, and **OpenTelemetry**
- Private cloud tooling, self-hosted services, and hardened deployments

### 📊 Data & Transparency Projects
- Open data platforms promoting civic transparency (e.g., *Conócelos* — tracking Chilean deputies)
- Custom scrapers, automation bots, public APIs, and real-time data visualizations

## 📁 Repository Structure

Our codebase is organized by domain:

- **`infra-*`**: Infrastructure as Code — Terraform modules, cluster bootstrap configs, cloud-init, etc.
- **`cluster-*`**: Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, GitOps pipelines
- **`tools-*`**: Reusable DevOps utilities and GitHub Actions
- **`data-*`**: Data scraping, API services, and visualization layers
- **`apps-*`**: Admin panels or UIs (usually built with Next.js)

## 🌍 Philosophy

At NAKAMALABS, we build systems that are:

- **Composable** — built with interchangeable, open components
- **Observable** — metrics-first mindset from the start
- **Secure by Default** — access control and protection at every layer
- **Automation-Driven** — zero-click deploys, GitOps-first pipelines
- **Remote-Ready** — we eat our own dogfood as digital nomads
